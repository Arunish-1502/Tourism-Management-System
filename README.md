# Tourism-Management-System


â€¢	Developed a tourism management system application in collaboration where there are 3 different portals for admin, user and manager who all have different set of functionalities like create, edit or delete packages for admin and select package, online payment, raising complaints, queries, giving feedbacks etc. for user and managing it all and feedback creation for manager. Reports for booking and feedbacks are also generated and are in downloadable excel format.

Database password and other details should be exactly as in the queries and in properties file of the code and these should be created before hand as it is a pre requisite before running this and keep in mind the port number while running and it will work fine on any system provided the platform should be windows.
